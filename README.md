# An attempt- Detection of COVID-19 presence from Chest X-ray scans using CNN


The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19), with a starting point in China, has spread rapidly among people living in other countries, and is approaching approximately 24,99,723 cases worldwide according to the statistics of European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. There are a limited number of COVID-19 test kits available in hospitals due to the increasing cases daily. Therefore, it is necessary to implement an automatic Prediction system as a quick alternative diagnosis option to prevent COVID-19 spreading among people. Iâ€™am proposed for the prediction of coronavirus pneumonia infected patient using chest X-ray radiographs. the model gives highest classification performance with 97.78% accuracy on testing.
